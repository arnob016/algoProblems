Write a python program that takes two inputs. The first input is a string and the second input is a
number. If the number is even then concatenate the given string two times the given number and
if the number is odd then concatenate the given string three times the given number.

Sample Input 1:

CSE110

4

Sample output 1:

CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110

Explanation: The second input which is the number 4 is even, therefore the first-string input

'CSE110' is concatenated (joined together) 4*2 = 8 times.

Sample Input 2:

CSE110

3
Sample Output 2:

CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110CSE110
